# tensorflow

## Installation problem
If even after installing tensorflow, you get the error as `No module named 'tensorflow'`, then it is because you haven't run the following command:

For python 3.x `pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow`
Please note that at present(6-Jan-2018) tensorflow does not support 3.6. So it is advised to install 3.5.x to run your progrmas.

For python 2.7 `pip install --upgrade tensorflow`

The above command will install the wheels.
