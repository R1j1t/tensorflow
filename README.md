# `from tensorflow import notes`

These are my notes of tensorflow.

[Getting started Page](Getting%20started): You should start from here and then go to below topics. Inspired and adapted from tensorflow website.

[Dataset](tf.data): This page will help in basic understanding of providing input data to the function. <br />
[Advanced Dataset](reading_data): This page holds a more in-depth notes, adapted from Tensorflow and StackeExchange website

[Estimator module in Tensor flow](estimators): This will give you a basic understanding of models from training to predictions.

[Extras Page](extras): These are extra notes will mostly include something interesting and/or terminologies related to tf.

More pages will be added over time.
